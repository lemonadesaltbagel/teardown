# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-22)

First public release.

### The loop

- **Observe.** The observe MCP server (stdio or HTTP) and the Python API: targets, actions, mappers,
  sequences, field probes, observer-authored rules checked against the original, coverage with unknowns, and
  automata learning (KV / L#).
- **Gate.**
  - Verbatim (suffix automaton) and near-verbatim (winnowing) checks against everything observed and ingested.
  - Real names replaced by a codename; a functional-quote ledger.
  - Strict mode with classified findings and terminal-only approvals (`teardown review`, `approve`, `release`).
- **Rebuild.**
  - Clean-room kits (`teardown export-clean`) for CLI, web and Android targets.
  - A verifier that runs the original and the clone through the same tests and returns abstract verdicts.
- **Audit.** A hash-chained, DSSE-signed in-toto statement log (`teardown audit-verify`).

### Targets

- **CLI (stable).**
  - A locked-down container runner: no network, read-only, unprivileged.
  - Help discovery, probe planning, decision-table claim mining, noise calibration.
  - Stdio and permission faults.
- **Web (stable).**
  - Playwright with a determinism profile; accessibility-tree symbols.
  - Fault injection (5xx, network, timeout, malformed body, held requests).
  - Query-string routes, public-contract selectors, replayed CDN assets, date masking.
  - A value-free API contract and endpoint × fault coverage.
- **Android (working).**
  - adb with an on-device UiAutomation agent; network-off fault.
  - Gradle-free clone builds (`android:kit`).
- **Linux desktop (experimental).** Xvfb + AT-SPI in a container.

### Enforced rooms

- `teardown cleanroom`: the implementer sees only the kit; egress goes only to the gate and the model API.
- `teardown observerroom`: the observer reaches the target only through the observe MCP server.
- An allowlisting egress proxy with a per-attempt log, and isolation probes (`check`).

### Results

All results were scored on hidden suites with pinned denominators (see `docs/evaluation.md`):

- novel CLI tool: 397/397;
- novel Android app, both sides confined: 113/118;
- RealWorld Conduit: 99/101 (development set);
- `jq`: 394/429, with the contamination lesson.
